/*Doing a task can take a few seconds. You may wonder what happens if one of the consumers starts a long task and dies with it only partly done. Spring AMQP by default takes a conservative approach to message acknowledgement. If the listener throws an exception the container calls:
channel.basicReject(deliveryTag, requeue)
Requeue is true by default unless you explicitly set:
defaultRequeueRejected=false
or the listener throws an AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException. This is typically the behavior you want from your listener. In this mode there is no need to worry about a forgotten acknowledgement. After processing the message the listener calls:
channel.basicAck()
Acknowledgement must be sent on the same channel the delivery was received on. Attempts to acknowledge using a different channel will result in a channel-level protocol exception. */
